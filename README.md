    Botte monorepo
  </h1>
  <p align="center">
    A project, Botte Backend, and a collection of clients for its interfaces,
     plus libs.<br>
    Botte is just a bot that sends messages to me, via Telegram for now.
  <p>
</p>

<br>

In this monorepo there are 2 categories of software:
- üìö `libs`: standalone Python libs that can be installed individually from the Git subdir.
  - `libs/*`: eg. `libs/botte-dynamodb-tasks`. Used only by projects/libs in this
    monorepo.
  - `libs/public-clients/*`: eg. `libs/public-clients/botte-http-client`. Clients 
     for Botte Backend interfaces, meant to be used outside this repo.
- üí° `projects`: only `projects/botte-be` for now. Deployed as (a set of) Lambdas.


üìê Architecture
================

The backend, [botte-be project](projects/botte-be), is a set of Lambda functions triggered:
 - via [Lambda direct invocation](libs/public-clients/botte-lambda-client): used by
    consumers in AWS services inside the same AWS account (and with the right 
    permission to invoke the Lambda);
 - via [HTTPS](libs/public-clients/botte-http-client) with a secret auth token: 
    used by any consumer (and maybe, in the future, by Telegram webhook configured for
    Telegram user commands like `/echo`, see the old, and now 
    archived [patatrack-monorepo](https://github.com/puntonim/patatrack-monorepo); do not use this in a AWS service, but rather
    prefer the Lambda direct invocation;
 - via [SQS task Queue](libs/public-clients/botte-sqs-client): no consumers yet - 
    COMMENTED OUT because it incurs a little cost;
 - via [DynamoDB task Table](libs/public-clients/botte-dynamodb-client): used by Lambda
    consumers that are inside a VPC that has no internet connection (so they cannot use
    the HTTP interface - internet connection in a VPC is not free) but have a 
    VPC Gateway Endpoint to DynamoDB; example: the old, and now archived, Contabel
    project in [patatrack-monorepo](https://github.com/puntonim/patatrack-monorepo)
    that was inside a VPC because it used a SQLite DB in EFS (and EFS requires a VPC).

Each of the interfaces has a client distributed in this repo.

The Telegram's and HTTP's secrets are stored in Parameters Store.

No database.

*SQS queues commented out to avoid costs*
-----------------------------------------
I commented out the SQS task queues interface to avoid costs in AWS and because unused
 yet.

SQS is charged by (million) requests per month (and the first 1M is free).\
Note: requests and NOT messages.

A Lambda triggered by an SQS generates 15 requests per minutes by polling (and getting
 empty receives most of the time).\
This means 15*60*24*30=648k requests/month.

So 1 SQS+Lambda is free, but more than that will incur costs.\
In a case (old Patatrack monorepo) with 3 SQS I was charged around $0.30 a month.

The free alternative to the general usage of SQS is to use SNS + Lambda or
 DynamoDB Table + Stream + Lambda.\
They both use notifications instead of polling.

Btw: the solution DynamoDB Table + Stream + Lambda also solves the problem of a Lambda
 in a VPC (and without connection to the Internet or to other AWS services - because
 Internet connection in a VPC is not free ) that needs to trigger another Lambda
 (outside the VPC) that has Internet access. Example: see Botte and Fritarol in the
 old, and now archived,
 [patatrack-monorepo](https://github.com/puntonim/patatrack-monorepo).


‚ö° Usage
=====

There are [handy clients](libs/public-clients) for all Botte Backend interfaces.

Lambda Interface
----------------
You can use this interface by invoking the Lambda directly in the AWS website,
 using `aws-cli`, using Python and `boto3`, or with the handy client in this monorepo:
 [botte-lambda-client](libs/public-clients/botte-lambda-client)

It can be used by AWS infra inside the same AWS account (and with the right permission
 to invoke the Lambda).

The payload to be sent is:
```py
{
    "text": "Hello world from aws-lambda-client pytests!",
    "sender_app": "AWS_LAMBDA_CLIENT"  # sender_app is optional.
}
```

HTTP Interface
--------------
You can invoke this interface with curl, any other HTTP client or with the handy client
 in this monorepo: [botte-http-client](libs/public-clients/botte-http-client)

Example with curl:
```shell
$ curl -X POST https://5t325uqwq7.execute-api.eu-south-1.amazonaws.com/message \
   -H 'Authorization: XXX' \
   -d '{"text": "Hello World", "sender_app": "CURL_TEST"}'  # sender_app is optional.
{
  "message_id": 8,
  "from": {
    "id": 6570886232,
    "is_bot": true,
    "first_name": "Botte",
    "username": "realbottebot"
  },
  "chat": {
    "id": 2137200685,
    "first_name": "Paolo",
    "username": "punto...",
    "type": "private"
  },
  "date": 1698264386,
  "text": "Hello World"
}
```

üí¨ Telegram configuration
=========================

Create a Bot, get a token and your chat_id
------------------------------------------

The first step is the creation of the new bot with Telegram. Do it by sending
 the message `/newbot` to `@BotFather`, as stated in the docs:
https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token
The response will include a token to be stored in AWS Parameter Store 
 (see [README.md](projects/botte-be/README.md) in botte-be).

The bot should be able to send messages to your target profile (`@punto...` in my case):
 in order to do so you have to send a message from your target profile to the bot
 (so initiate a conversation).

Finally, you need to know the `chat_id` of your target profile (`@punto...` in my case): 
 to do so the quickest way is to send a message to `@JsonDumpBot` and keep track of
 `message.chat.id`. Then store it in `./botte/conf/settings` in 
 `settings.PUNTONIM_CHAT_ID`.

Set the webhook for Telegram user commands
------------------------------------------
In the future, we might want to handle  Telegram user commands like `/echo`, via
 webhooks. In this case see what done in the old, and now archived,
 [botte project](https://github.com/puntonim/patatrack-monorepo/tree/main/projects/botte#set-the-webhook-for-user-commands)
 in patatrck-monorepo.
