**Botte monorepo**
==================

A project, Botte, and a collection of clients for its interfaces.
Botte is just a bot that sends messages, via Telegram for now.

There are 2 categories of software:
- `libs`: eg. `libs/botte-http-client`. They are standalone Python libs that can be
 installed individually from the Git subdir. They are versioned.
- `projects`: eg. `projects/botte-be`. Deployed as (a set of) Lambdas.
