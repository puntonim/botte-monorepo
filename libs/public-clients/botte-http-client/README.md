    üåê Botte monorepo: Botte HTTP client
  </h1>
  <p align="center">
    Just a client for Botte Backend HTTP interface.
  <p>
</p>

<br>

‚ö° Usage
=======

Use this client to interact with Botte, via HTTP.\
Do not use this in AWS services, but rather prefer `botte-lambda-client`.

See top docstring in [http_client.py](botte_http_client/http_client.py).

Also, see details of the HTTP interface in [README.md](../../../README.md) in the root dir.

*Note: if you need a Botte client to be used in a AWS service, use 
 [botte-lambda-client](../botte-lambda-client) instead, for a direct Lambda invocation*.
