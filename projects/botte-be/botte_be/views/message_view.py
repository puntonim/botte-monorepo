# Objects declared outside the Lambda's handler method are part of Lambda's
# *execution environment*. This execution environment is sometimes reused for subsequent
# function invocations. Note that you can not assume that this always happens.
# Typical use cases: database connection and log init. The same db connection can be
# re-used in some subsequent function invocations. It is recommended though to add
# logic to check if a connection already exists before creating a new one.
# The execution environment also provides 512 MB of *disk space* in the /tmp directory.
# Again, this can be re-used in some subsequent function invocations.
# See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtime-environment.html#static-initialization

# This Lambda is configured with 0 retries. So do raise exceptions in the view.

    Handler for the Lambda function triggered by a direct invocation (not via API
     Gateway event) with a dict payload.
    It sends a Telegram message from the registered bot to the target user (me), with
     the text given in the request body.

    Args:
        event: a dict, the payload.
        context: the context passed to the Lambda.

    The `event` is a dict like:
        {
            "text": "Hello world from aws-lambda-client pytests!",
            "sender_app": "AWS_LAMBDA_CLIENT"  # sender_app is optional.
        }

    The `context` is a `LambdaContext` instance with properties similar to:
        {
            "level": "INFO",
            "location": "/var/task/botte/views/endpoint_message_view.py::lambda_handler::31",
